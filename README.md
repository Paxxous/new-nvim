CURRENTLY YOUR VERSION OF NEOVIM IS UNDER `archive-nvim` AND GITHUB, DON'T WORRY
# new-nvim

The new dotfiles for my neovim config!

Reorganized things, clutter free, (still a lot of plugins, but it works nicely)

Features:

    1. nvim-lsp,
    1. nvim-cmp,
    1. idfk

lsp and cmp are really the exciting bits, I loved coc but come on, I'm using neovim, I can go so much faster :D

(Also now Arch linux!!! gonna migrate from ubuntu to there so expect a couple of big repos)
